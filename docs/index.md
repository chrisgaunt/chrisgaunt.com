# Welcome

Hi, I'm a full-stack web developer working in the UK.  
I also worked for 6 years in Japan, and enjoy visiting again whenever possible.

I currently work primarily in PHP using Laravel, Laravel Livewire, Vue, AWS and MySQL.  
I've  worked extensively in the past with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL.

More content coming soon.
